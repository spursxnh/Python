# Hello World

Hi humans!

spursxnh here, I was a Thermal Energy and Power Engineering Professional Engineerã€‚
Now that I think computer programming is very creative, I am also very interested in this, and I plan to start the journey of learning programming. I am now learning the Python language. I am more interested in data analysis and AI. I hope everything goes well!
